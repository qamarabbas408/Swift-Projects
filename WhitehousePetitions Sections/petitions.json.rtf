Because injuries are work-related, private insurance refuses to cover treatment and survivors are required to go through the Countyxs self-administered workers comp, and utilization review (UR). The State of California stated that treatments can be approved by the County instead of UR. But the County insists on using UR and continues to delay/deny care. See www.sbsurvivors.com\\n\\nWe request the President to issue an executive order making it illegal for the County of San Bernardino to use UR for survivors AND mandating the County to approve, retroactively and in the future, ALL treatment for Dec. 2 survivors.",\

         "body":"Since Trump&#039;s inauguration, his administration has placed gag bans and lockdowns on several scientific and environmental agencies such as the EPA, FDA, USDA, the National Parks Service and several other organizations from Cabinet-level on down. This is unacceptable. These organizations all work towards our safety: climate change, environment, medicine, food etc. There is no valid reason for these gag orders but to control the flow of information to the public which funds them. These are purely political moves for political gain since this is the most business-loving administration in US history.  xWhen you tear out a man&#039;s tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you&#039;re only telling the world that you fear what he might say.x George R.R. Martin, A Clash of Kings",\
